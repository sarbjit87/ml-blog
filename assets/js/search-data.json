Vectorization : . In high-level languages the term vectorization refers to use of pre-compiled, optimized code written in language like C to perform mathematical operations over sequence of data. Basically, this is done without writing &quot;for&quot; loop in Python. . Python native list allows elements to be of different data types as opposed to Numpy array where the elements have to be of same data type. This property allows mathematical operations to be delecated to pre-compiled code written in C to gain performance improvements. . a = np.arange(16).reshape(4,4) b = np.arange(16).reshape(4,4) print(&quot;Array a is n&quot;,a,&quot; n n&quot;,&quot;Array b is n&quot;,b, &quot; n&quot;) # Element wise operation print(&quot;a + 2 : Adding 2 to each element :- &quot;,&quot; n&quot;,a+2, &quot; n&quot;) print(&quot;a - 2 : Subtracting 2 from each element :- &quot;,&quot; n&quot;,a-2, &quot; n&quot;) print(&quot;a / 2 : Dividing 2 from each element :- &quot;,&quot; n&quot;,a/2, &quot; n&quot;) print(&quot;a * 2 : Multiplying 2 from each element :- &quot;,&quot; n&quot;,a*2, &quot; n&quot;) .

Broadcasting :- . When we perform arithemetic operations on two arrays, the operations are performed element wise. One condition to perform such operations is that the arrays should be of same shape. . Broadcasting is a technique used by Numpy to perform operations on arrays of different shapes. . Subject to certain constraints, the smaller array is “broadcast” across the larger array so that they have compatible shapes. Broadcasting provides a means of vectorizing array operations so that looping occurs in C instead of Python. It does this without making needless copies of data and usually leads to efficient algorithm implementations. [From Numpy.org] . a = np.array([1, 2, 3]) b = np.array([2, 2, 2]) print(a+b) . [3 4 5] . Example 1 :- . In the below example, we are performing operations between an array and scalar. Scalar can be considered as another array (dimensionless). If you look at the results, they are identical to the example above (where b is an 1*3 array with 2 as an element). . In this case, the smaller array (scalar) is broadcasted across the larger array i.e. the smaller array is duplicated to match the dimensions and size of larger array. . (Image Source : Numpy.org) . a = np.array([1, 2, 3]) b = 2 print(a+b) . [3 4 5] . Example 2 :- . In this example, a 1-D array is added to a 2-D array. . (Image Source : Numpy.org) . a = np.array([[0, 0, 0], [10, 10, 10], [20, 20, 20], [30, 30, 30]]) b = np.array([[0, 1, 2]]) print(a+b) . [[ 0 1 2] [10 11 12] [20 21 22] [30 31 32]] . Broadcasting Rules :- . Rule 1: If the two arrays differ in their number of dimensions, the shape of the one with fewer dimensions is padded with ones on its leading (left) side. . Rule 2: If the shape of the two arrays does not match in any dimension, the array with shape equal to 1 in that dimension is stretched to match the other shape. . Rule 3: If in any dimension the sizes disagree and neither is equal to 1, an error is raised. . # Example 1 a = np.ones((2,4)) b = np.arange(4) print(&quot;Array a is :-&quot;) print(a) print(&quot; nArray b is :-&quot;) print(b) print(&quot; nShape of array a is :-&quot;) print(a.shape) # =&gt; (2,4) print(&quot; nShape of array b is :-&quot;) print(b.shape) # =&gt; (4,) # Apply rule 1 on the array with fewer dimensions i.e. pad with ones on left side # a.shape =&gt; (2,4) # b.shape =&gt; (1,4) # Apply rule 2 : Stretch the dimension for array b accross dimension with 1&#39;s # a.shape =&gt; (2,4) # b.shape =&gt; (2,4) # Apply rule 3 : Dimensions matches print(&quot; n a+b is :-&quot;) print(a+b) # View broadcasted arrays x, y = np.broadcast_arrays(a, b) print(&quot; nArray a after broadcasting is (before addition) :-&quot;) print(x) print(&quot; nArray b after broadcasting is (before addition) :-&quot;) print(y) .

            "content": "Linear Regression is one of the common and popular algorithm in Machine Learning. Infact, typically this would be the first algorithm that you will encounter while learning Machine Learning. . Linear regression as the name suggests is a model that assumes a linear relationship between independent variable (x) and the dependent or target variable (y). There are two types on Linear Regression Model :- . Simple Linear Regression : Linear model between one independent variable (x) and target variable (y). . Multiple Linear Regression : Linear model between two or more independent variables (x1, x2 ...) and target variable (y). . Linear regression model would predict the output (dependent variable) as a function of independent variable. . Y = a + b X . where, Y : Predictor Variable X : Independent Variable a : Intercept of regression line (i.e. value of Y when X=0) b : Slope of regression line (i.e. rate of change of Y when X is incremented by 1 unit) . For Multiple Linear Regression, equation would be . Y = a + b1X1 + b2X2 + b3X3 + ...... . Let&#39;s start with Linear Regression using Python.

Let&#39;s use some visualization techniques on our data to understand the distribution and relationship of independent variables with our target variable. . For distribution of data, we will use Histogram. Before proceeding, let&#39;s look at what Histogram is :- . A histogram is a type of bar graph that shows the frequency or number of values compared to a set of value ranges. To construct a histogram, the first step is to “bin” the range of values — that is, divide the entire range of values into a series of intervals — and then count how many values fall into each interval. The bins are usually specified as consecutive, non-overlapping intervals of a variable. The bins (intervals) must be adjacent, and are often (but are not required to be) of equal size. . Let&#39;s use histogram to view the data distribution in our case. Look closely at our target (MEDV) and notice that the prices are mainly in the mid range distribution. . df.hist(bins=30, figsize=(18,18)) . array([[&lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot object at 0x1a1cfa5320&gt;, &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot object at 0x1a1d240780&gt;, &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot object at 0x1a1d268be0&gt;, &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot object at 0x1a1d29a198&gt;], [&lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot object at 0x1a1d2bf710&gt;, &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot object at 0x1a1d2e7ba8&gt;, &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot object at 0x1a1d316160&gt;, &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot object at 0x1a1d33c710&gt;], [&lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot object at 0x1a1d33c748&gt;, &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot object at 0x1a1d394208&gt;, &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot object at 0x1a1d3ba780&gt;, &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot object at 0x1a1d3e1cf8&gt;], [&lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot object at 0x1a1d4102b0&gt;, &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot object at 0x1a1d437828&gt;, &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot object at 0x1a1d45eda0&gt;, &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot object at 0x1a1d48e358&gt;]], dtype=object) . To visualize the relationship between independent variables and target variable (MEDV), we will use Regression Plot, which is basically a Scatter Plot with fitted regression line. We use regression plot for variables with continous values, while a box plot will be used for categorical variables. . plt.figure(figsize=(25, 25)) for i, col in enumerate(boston.feature_names): plt.subplot(4, 4 , i+1) sns.regplot(x=col, y=&#39;MEDV&#39;, data=df) plt.title(&quot;%s vs MEDV&quot; %(col)) . Observations so far :- . Variable &#39;RM&#39; seems to have positive linear relationship with target variable &#39;MEDV&#39;. | Variable &#39;LSTAT&#39; seems to have negative linear relationship with target variable &#39;MEDV&#39;. | . Let&#39;s use other statistical methods to confirm our observations. We will use Pearson Corelation as our statistical tool. . What is Pearson Corelation? . A Pearson Corelation is a number between -1 and 1 which indicates the extent to which two variables are linearly related. . Corelation Cofficient: . 1 - Positively correlated -1 - Negatively correlated. 0 - Not correlated. . P-value: . The P-value is the probability value that the correlation between these two variables is statistically significant. . By convention, when the . p-value is &lt; 0.001: we say there is strong evidence that the correlation is significant. the p-value is &lt; 0.05: there is moderate evidence that the correlation is significant. the p-value is &lt; 0.1: there is weak evidence that the correlation is significant. the p-value is &gt; 0.1: there is no evidence that the correlation is significant. . We will use the Pandas data frame method &quot;corr()&quot; to find the co-relation and then use the Seaborn&#39;s Heatmap to plot it. . sns.set(rc={&#39;figure.figsize&#39;:(8,8)}) sns.heatmap(df.corr().round(2), square=True, cmap=&#39;RdYlGn&#39;, annot=True) . &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x1a203d7b70&gt; . We observed visually that attributes &#39;RM&#39; exhibits postive linear relationship, which seems correct as per Corelation Cofficient with a value of 0.7. We also observed that &#39;LSTAT&#39; exhibits negative linear relationship with &#39;MEDV&#39; and this seems to be correct statistically as well with a cofficient value of -0.74. . Let&#39;s also look at the p-value as well. . pearson_coef1, p_value1 = stats.pearsonr(df[&#39;RM&#39;], df[&#39;MEDV&#39;]) print(&quot;The Pearson Correlation Coefficient for RM is&quot;, pearson_coef1, &quot; with a P-value of P = &quot;, p_value1) pearson_coef2, p_value2 = stats.pearsonr(df[&#39;LSTAT&#39;], df[&#39;MEDV&#39;]) print(&quot;The Pearson Correlation Coefficient for LSTAT is&quot;, pearson_coef2, &quot; with a P-value of P = &quot;, p_value2) print(&quot;Is there strong evidence if corelation is signifcant for RM :- &quot;, p_value1 &lt; 0.001) print(&quot;Is there strong evidence if corelation is signifcant for LSTAT :- &quot;, p_value2 &lt; 0.001) . The Pearson Correlation Coefficient for RM is 0.6953599470715393 with a P-value of P = 2.487228871008295e-74 The Pearson Correlation Coefficient for LSTAT is -0.7376627261740147 with a P-value of P = 5.081103394389002e-88 Is there strong evidence if corelation is signifcant for RM :- True Is there strong evidence if corelation is signifcant for LSTAT :- True . As you can notice, our corelation is significant for variables &#39;RM&#39; and &#39;LSTAT&#39;. . Linear Model Creation . Now that we have indentified few variables which appears to have linear relationship with our target data, we will start developing the Linear Regression Model. . We will start with Simple Linear Regression. As stated above, Simple Linear Regression only uses one variable, so we will use only &#39;RM&#39; attribute. . First, we will import the LinearRegression class from the SciKit library and create a LinearRegression object. Then we will train the model, find the slope and intercept and finally we will do some prediction. . NOTE : For this post as part of explaining linear regression model, I will be using the entire data set for training. In real world, we will split the data into test and training data. This will be covered in a later post. . from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression # Create Linear Regression Object lm1 = LinearRegression() X1 = df[[&#39;RM&#39;]] Y1 = df[[&#39;MEDV&#39;]] # Target # Fit (Train) the model lm1.fit(X1,Y1) print(&quot;Intercept for the model is&quot;, lm1.intercept_, &quot;and the scope is&quot;,lm1.coef_) # Prediction Yout1 = lm1.predict(X1) # Actual and Predicted values (first five) print(&quot;Predicted Values:&quot;,Yout1[0:5]) print(&quot;Actual Values:&quot;,Y1.values[0:5]) . Intercept for the model is [-34.67062078] and the scope is [[9.10210898]] Predicted Values: [[25.17574577] [23.77402099] [30.72803225] [29.02593787] [30.38215211]] Actual Values: [[24. ] [21.6] [34.7] [33.4] [36.2]] . Now, we will develop the Multiple Linear Regression with two variables - &#39;RM&#39; and &#39;LSTAT&#39;. . lm2 = LinearRegression() X2 = df[[&#39;RM&#39;, &#39;LSTAT&#39;]] Y2 = df[[&#39;MEDV&#39;]] # Fit (Train) the model lm2.fit(X2,Y2) print(&quot;Intercept for the model is&quot;, lm2.intercept_, &quot;and the scope is&quot;,lm2.coef_) # Prediction Yout2 = lm2.predict(X2) # Actual and Predicted values (first five) print(&quot;Predicted Values:&quot;,Yout2[0:5]) print(&quot;Actual Values:&quot;,Y2.values[0:5]) . Intercept for the model is [-1.35827281] and the scope is [[ 5.09478798 -0.64235833]] Predicted Values: [[28.94101368] [25.48420566] [32.65907477] [32.40652 ] [31.63040699]] Actual Values: [[24. ] [21.6] [34.7] [33.4] [36.2]] . Model Visualization . We will visualize our models that we have created. For Simple Linear Regression, we can either use Regression Plot or Residual Plot. In case of regression plot, we need to focus on spread of data from regression line. If the data is too far from regression line, then we can say that Linear Model is not the best fit. . Since we have already used Regression Plot, we will use Residual Plot. A Residual is the difference between observed value (Y) and predicted value (Yout). In residual plot, X-axis will have independent variable and Y-Axis will have residuals. . What to look in residual plot? . If the points in a residual plot are randomly spread out around the x-axis, then a linear model is appropriate for the data. Randomly spread out residuals means that the variance is constant, and thus the linear model is a good fit for this data. | . # Seaborn library to be used for Residual Plot plt.figure(figsize=(6,6)) sns.residplot(df[&#39;RM&#39;],df[&#39;MEDV&#39;]) plt.show() . For Multiple Linear Regression, we can&#39;t use Regression or Residual Plot because of multiple independent variables, so we will use Distribution Plot. . plt.figure(figsize=(6,6)) ax1 = sns.distplot(df[&#39;MEDV&#39;], hist=False, color=&quot;r&quot;, label=&quot;Actual&quot;) sns.distplot(Yout2, hist=False, color=&quot;b&quot;, label=&quot;Fitted&quot;, ax=ax1) . &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x1a1e74a748&gt; . Model Accuracy . We will use the following quantitative methods for finding model accuracy. . Mean Squared Error (MSE) . The Mean Squared Error measures the average of the squares of errors. It is calculated by :- . Finding the error between actual and predicted value | Taking a square of it | Sum up all the values | Divide by number of values | . R-squared . R squared, also known as the coefficient of determination is a measure to indicate how close the data is to the fitted regression line. . R^2 = 1 - MSE of regression line / MSE of average of data . Which one is better model? . Model will less MSE and high R-Square value | . We can use the sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error to find the Mean Squared Error and model score() method to obtain R-Square value. . from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error # Simple Linear Regression mse1 = mean_squared_error(Y1,Yout1) print(&quot;Mean square error for simple linear regression is&quot;,mse1) print(&quot;R-Square value for simple linear regression is&quot;, lm1.score(X1,Y1)) print(&quot; n&quot;) # Multiple Linear Regression mse2 = mean_squared_error(Y2,Yout2) print(&quot;Mean square error for mulitple linear regression is&quot;,mse2) print(&quot;R-Square value for multiple linear regression is&quot;, lm2.score(X2,Y2)) . Mean square error for simple linear regression is 43.60055177116956 R-Square value for simple linear regression is 0.4835254559913343 Mean square error for mulitple linear regression is 30.51246877729947 R-Square value for multiple linear regression is 0.6385616062603403 . We can see that the multiple linear regression model seems to perform better because of high R-Square value and low mean square error. . Model Evaluation : Train and Test Data, Cross Validation . As I mentioned before, in real-world we will split our data into test and training data to evaluate our model. We will use &quot;train_test_split&quot; method to split our data into testing and training data. In this section, I will be using Multiple Regression Model to illustrate this process. . # First step that we will take is to seperate target data y_data = df[&#39;MEDV&#39;] x_data = df.drop(&#39;MEDV&#39;,axis=1) from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split # Split the data into test and training (15% as test data) x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x_data, y_data, test_size=0.15, random_state=10) print(&quot;Number of test samples :&quot;, x_test.shape[0]) print(&quot;Number of training samples:&quot;,x_train.shape[0]) lm = LinearRegression() # Fit (Train) the model using the training data lm.fit(x_train[[&#39;RM&#39;,&#39;LSTAT&#39;]],y_train) # Prediction using Training Data yout_train = lm.predict(x_train[[&#39;RM&#39;,&#39;LSTAT&#39;]]) print(yout_train[0:5]) # Prediction using Test Data yout_test = lm.predict(x_test[[&#39;RM&#39;,&#39;LSTAT&#39;]]) print(yout_test[0:5]) print(&quot; n&quot;) # Model accuracy using Test Data mse_test = mean_squared_error(y_test,yout_test) print(&quot;Mean square error is&quot;,mse_test) print(&quot;R-Square value using test data is&quot;, lm.score(x_test[[&#39;RM&#39;,&#39;LSTAT&#39;]],y_test)) print(&quot; n&quot;) # Model accuracy using Training Data mse_train = mean_squared_error(y_train,yout_train) print(&quot;Mean square error is&quot;,mse_train) print(&quot;R-Square value using training data is&quot;, lm.score(x_train[[&#39;RM&#39;,&#39;LSTAT&#39;]],y_train)) . Number of test samples : 76 Number of training samples: 430 [38.74400503 5.69000561 19.41554723 30.26876646 21.13562849] [26.21310048 29.61955969 27.50797208 29.69508151 17.77881853] Mean square error is 47.91753944668556 R-Square value using test data is 0.5784951912105682 Mean square error is 27.636206385020866 R-Square value using training data is 0.6375993387266081 . Cross Validation : . Division of data into testing and training data may result into a problem especially if the data is sorted by some particular features and our testing data does not have that data. With Cross Validation, we will use entire subset of data for training and testing in iterations. This is just a brief introduction on this topic and there are other methods to perform cross validation. . In the example below, we are using K-Fold validation technique and dividing our data into 5 folds and each of the fold will be used as a test data. We will then take the mean of all the iterations. . from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, KFold rcross = cross_val_score(lm, x_data, y_data, cv=KFold(n_splits=5,shuffle=True)) print(rcross) print(&quot;The mean of the folds are&quot;, rcross.mean()) . [0.62229666 0.7348349 0.74170714 0.65677571 0.77563056] The mean of the folds are 0.7062489913934608 .",

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
